## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

As part of the Graduate Research in Electrical Engineering. Develop a pipeline for traffic data analysis using vision data. 


## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

The notebook is available here to showcase step by step process for how tracker program works. Markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps.  

The .py file can be ran independently from the command line as: python tracker.py --video "address to video"
